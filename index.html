											<h3><b>Neuroleap Corp. — Machine Learning/iOS Development Intern</b> <br><i>january 2020 - july 2021</i></h3>
											<p>Neuroleap is an artificial intelligence (AI) based company that focuses on
												using AI to allow kids with learning disabilities to be diagnosed and to learn
												more efficiently at their own pace. I was assigned to update the existing application
												and create a brand new application for the optical learning platform. I changed
												all the source code of the application to make it run on the most recent version
												of swift (swift 5), through this process I fixed all the bugs that came up and now
												the application has been deployed and is in use. As a machine learning intern, we used
												OpenCV and Tensorflow to predict what letter a child is writing in the air and to analyze
												the child’s movements and facial features. Through this analysis educators will be able
												to recognize symptoms of dyslexia, tourette's syndrome, down syndrome and more.</p>

											<h3><b>Let'sEat — Marketing and Development Intern</b> <br><i>september 2017 - november 2017</i></h3>
											<p>Let’sEat is a food delivery platform. As the marketing and development intern I was tasked with
												understanding the potential of expanding the application and adding high school students and
												teenagers as part of the target audience. I helped by taking multiple surveys from students at my
												school. I was working closely with the CEO and co-founders on a daily basis to discuss the potential
												of collaborating with other companies.</p>

												<p>MVOctagon is an application for Monta Vista High School’s Octagon
													Volunteering club. The application was made to solve the problem of
													 people signing up for events, not showing up, but still getting the
													 hours. The app has a built-in location tracker to see if people are
													 near the volunteer location during  the check in and check out times,
													 as this will serve as proof of volunteering. Furthermore, the app
													 will keep track of everyone’s volunteer hours and all completed events.
													 For this application I was interviewed and featured in our schools award
													 winning magazine.</p>
